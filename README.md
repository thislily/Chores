# ChoreQuest

**ChoreQuest** is a small web app (who needs a better name), designed to help kids (currently just mine) complete their household chores in a fun and interactive way. This app provides a list of daily tasks as cards that can be flipped as completed, helping kids stay on track with their responsibilities.

## Live Demo

You can view the live version of the app [here](https://chorequest.netlify.app/).
